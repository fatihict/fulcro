== Fulcro 2.0

WORK IN PROGRESS -- NOT FOR PRODUCTION

Fulcro 2.0 maintains the majority of API compatibility with 1.0, but has forked from Om Next due to
a number of things:

* We wanted better control of our release cycle and bug fix schedule.
* Om's support of pluggable databases causes a number of complications we didn't need.
* Dynamic queries in Om Next use patterns that are at odds with some quite useful features:
** True serializable support viewer history in the presence of dynamic queries
** Reliable history navigation for error recovery
* The rendering optimizations in stock Om Next were quite aggressive, but led to quite a bit
of complication under the hood, which in turn showed up as bugs. Fulcro's choice of the built-in database format makes
these optimizations easier and hopefully more reliable.

=== Porting From Fulcro 1.0

1. Remove Om Next from your dependencies, if present
2. Update to Fulcro-spec 2.0+ (if using it)
3. Update to Fulcro 2.0+
4. Rename all of the Om namespaces to use the new ones in Fulcro, which are mostly API-compatible:
+
In Linux and OSX (assuming your project is in git), this `rename-ns` script is useful:
+
```
#!/bin/bash

oldns=$1
newns=$2
files=$(git grep -l "$oldns")

if [ ! -z "$files" ]; then 
  perl -pi.bak -e 's/\b\Q'$oldns'\E\b/'$newns'/g' $files
  find . -name '*.bak' -print0 | xargs -0 -n100 rm
fi
```
+
You'll want to rename things *in order* (assuming you're using the above script):
+
```
rename-ns om.next.impl.parser fulcro.client.impl.parser
rename-ns om.next.protocols fulcro.client.impl.protocols
rename-ns om.next.server fulcro.server
rename-ns om.dom fulcro.client.dom
rename-ns om.tempid fulcro.tempid
rename-ns om.util fulcro.util
rename-ns om.next fulcro.client.primitives
```
+
5. Fix your use of `util` namespaces. There are now two util namespaces. This is an unfortunate consequence of the
forking process.
** `get-ident` is now just part of the `primitives` namespace
** The following functions that were in `fulcro.client.util` were moved to `fulcro.util`:
`unique-key`, `atom?`, `deep-merge`, and `conform!`

=== Dynamic Queries

If you don't use dynamic queries in Fulcro 1.0, then you're done!

If you've been wanting to use them but had problems because of how Om Next did them, read on!

Om Next supports setting queries at a component level (e.g. every instance on the screen). In reality, this doesn't
work very well (and is difficult to code correctly). Component instances cannot be stored in app state unless you're
willing to give up history serialization, and to-many relationships present real difficulties (imagine wanting to
set the query of the 2nd item in a list). Spurious React mount/unmounts will also lose your queries. Imagine changine
from one tab to another and back again only to have your dynamic queries clear in the original tab you just returned
to (because of the mount/unmount).

Fulcro 2.0 changes the appraoch. Instead of storing the queries in the indexer and state by React component, we
instead allow you to define the query ID (which is serializable). However, dynamic queries of this kind don't hide
the magic. The API for dynamic queries exposes the fact that getting a query is a function of the component's query ID
AND application state (since that is where custom ones are stored).

==== The trade-offs:

There is no free lunch. Fulcro 2.0's dynamic queries have the following properties:

* You *must* use/compose a different kind of query in your UI (`IDynamicQuery` instead of `IQuery`). The dynamic composition must
reach root using `IDynamicRoot`.
* You may target a new query to a specific React factory (with a qualifier). This allows you to dynamically set a query
on a subset of on-screen components that share a class.
* You may set a query class-wide. All instances on screen that share that class *and* use dynamic queries *and* do not have
a query qualifier will have the new query.

The down-side is that you cannot arbitrarily set a query on an arbitrary on-screen component. That would require
indexing by component React instace, and just doesn't work well with other features (react re-mounts and serializable
history). In practice dynamic queries are mainly needed for code splitting, and the fact that you can re-use a single
class with as many different qualifiers as you want means that the vast majority of dynamic query
desires can be easily met.

==== Query IDs

Query IDs are composed of two components: A component's class name, and an optional user-defined keyword qualifier. The
class and qualifier are needed when asking Fulcro for a query, and React instances that need targeted refresh will also
need to supply the underlying engine with the Query ID they were originally rendered with.

This implies that the best way to "name" a query without having to repeat yourself is by using a factory
(which has to know the class name and the qualifier in order to work). Thus,
Fulcro dynamic queries can define a factory with a query qualifier like so:

```
(def ui-thing-a (fulcro.client.primitives/factory Thing {:qualifier :a}))
(def ui-thing-b (fulcro.client.primitives/factory Thing {:qualifier :b}))
```

The example above gives you two separate kinds of `Thing` that can have their query set dynamically. If the qualifier is not
set, then setting a query on the given class will affect all instances on the screen that have that class.

==== The Dynamic Query API

The new dynamic query protocol looks like this:

```
(ns ui
  (:require [fulcro.client.primitives :as prim :refer [defui]]))

(declare ui-thing-a)

(defui Thing
  static prim/IDynamicQuery
  (dynamic-query [this state] [:prop {:join (prim/get-query ui-thing-a state)}])
  ; nothing else changes...
  )

(def ui-thing-a (fulcro.client.primitives/factory Thing {:qualifier :a}))
```

Changing queries must now be done within a mutation, because you need access to the app state. The new `set-query*`
function works on plain app-state, so it is easy to compose into a mutation:

```
(m/defmutation set-query [{:keys [factory args]}]
  (action [{:keys [state]}]
    (swap! state prim/set-query* factory args)))
```

The built-in mutations will probably include this basic mutation and a wrapper function around it for backwards API
compatibility with Om Next's `set-query!`. At the moment, you must write the mutation.

=== Status

* Server-side rendering is broken (build initial state is broken in clj for some reason).
* Advanced optimization is known to be broken. I have not yet put the externs and such in place.
* Dynamic queries work, but are not heavily tested. See the section on that.
** I need to test having non-dynamic subtrees. That probably doesn't yet work.
** Query parameters (e.g. IQueryParams) is as-yet untested.
** `set-query!` needs to be written
* Other than the renames and a few minor function moves (from util), it should be API compatible with existing Fulcro apps
* RENDERING REFRESH is known to have bugs. I have not finished writing the new refresh algorithm. The current version
should mostly work, but may screw up, especially when working with component local state (e.g. children might appear to
go back in time).
** I'm hoping that the new version is significantly faster than stock Om Next.
* New history support needed. I stripped out history for the moment, because 2.0 will include a much more powerful mechanism.
