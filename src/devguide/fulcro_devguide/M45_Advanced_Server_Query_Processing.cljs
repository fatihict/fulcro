  # Advanced Query Processing

  All incoming client communication will be in the form of Om Query/Mutation expressions. You've
  already seen that your `defquery-root` and `defquery-entity` are called for each separate element
  of a query or mutation; however, there is no built-in recursive processing, but the UI might
  prune the query (using `:without` or `load-field`) and the server should really only respond
  with that is requested; otherwise, you aren't being very data driven!

  The most important item in the query processing is the received environment (`env`). On
  the server it contains:

  - Anything components you've asked to be injected. Perhaps database and config components.
  - `ast`: An AST representation of the item being parsed.
  - `query`: The subquery (e.g. of a join)
  - `parser`: The query expression parser itself (which allows you to do recursive calls)
  - `request`: The full incoming Ring request, which will contain things like the headers, cookies, session, user agent info, etc.

  ## The super-easy case: Datomic

  If your database is Datomic, then you're most of the way done, since the query grammar is a subset of Datomic's pull
  syntax. Just find the correct starting point, and run the `query` against Datomic itself.

  If you're not using Datomic, then read on.

  ## The `env` Parser

  The parser is exactly what it sounds like: a parser for the query grammar. The one you
  get in `env` is already hooked into your dispatch mechanism (e.g. defquery-root).

  Thus, if you run `(parser env [:x])` you should see a dispatch to your `defquery-root` on `:x`.

  The return value of the parser will be a map containing keys for all of the queried items
  that had a non-nil result from the dispatches.

  If you understand that, you can probably already write a simple recursive parse of a query. If
  you need a bit more hand-holding, then read on.

  First, let's get a feeling for the parser in general:

  ")

(defcard om-parser
  "This card will run an Om parser on an arbitrary query, record the calls to the read emitter,
  and shows the trace of those calls in order. Feel free to look at the source of this card.

  Essentially, it creates an Om parser that dispatches reads to `read-tracking`:

  ```
   (om/parser {:read read-tracking})
  ```

  where the `read-tracking` simply stores details of each call in an atom and shows those calls
  when parse is complete.

  The signature of a read function is:

  `(read [env dispatch-key params])`

   where the env contains the state of your application, a reference to your parser (so you can
                                                                                        call it recursively, if you wish), a query root marker, an AST node describing the exact
  details of the element's meaning, a path, and *anything else* you want to put in there if
  you call the parser recursively.

  Try some queries like these:

  - `[:a :b]`
  - `[:a {:b [:c]}]` (note that the AST is recursively built, but only the top keys are actually parsed to trigger reads)
  - `[(:a { :x 1 })]`  (note the value of params)

  ### Injecting some kind of database

  In order to play with this on a server, you'll want to have some kind of state
  available. The most trivial thing you can do is just create a global top-level atom
  that holds data. This is sufficient for testing, and we'll assume we've done something
  like this on our server:

  ```
  (defonce state (atom {}))
  ```

  One could also wrap that in a Stuart Sierra component and inject it (as state) into the
  parser.

  Much of the remainder of this section assumes this.

  ## Read Dispatching

  When building your server there must be a read function that can
  pull data to fufill what the parser needs to fill in the result of a query. Fulcro supplies this by default
  and gives you the `defquery-*` macros as helpers to hook into it, but really it is just a multi-method.

  For educational purposes, we're going to walk you through implementing this read function yourself.

  The Om Next parser understands the grammar, and is written to work as follows:

  - The parser calls your `read` with the key that it parsed, along with some other helpful information.
  - Your read function returns a value for that key (possibly calling the parser recursively if it is a join).
  - The parser generates the result map by putting that key/value pair into
  the result at the correct position (relative to the query).

  Note that the parser only processes the query one level deep. Recursion (if you need it)
  is controlled by *you* calling the parser again from within the read function.
  ")

(defcard parser-read-trace
  "This card is similar to the prior card, but it has a read function that just records what keys it was
  triggered for. Give it an arbitrary legal query, and see what happens.

  Some interesting queries:

  - `[:a :b :c]`
  - `[:a {:b [:x :y]} :c]`
  - `[{:a {:b {:c [:x :y]}}}]`

  {}
  {:inspect-data false})

(defcard-doc
  "
  In the card above you should have seen that only the top-level keys trigger reads.

  So, the query:

  ```clj
  [:kw {:j [:v]}]
  ```

  would result in a call to your read function on `:kw` and `:j`. Two calls. No
  automatic recursion. Done. The output value of the *parser* will be a map (that
  parse creates) which contains the keys (from the query, copied over by the
  parser) and values (obtained from your read):

  ```clj
  { :kw value-from-read-for-kw :j value-from-read-for-j }
  ```

  Note that if your read accidentally returns a scalar for `:j` then you've not
  done the right thing...a join like `{ :j [:k] }` expects a result that is a
  vector of (zero or more) things *or* a singleton *map* that contains key
  `:k`.

  ```clj
  { :kw 21 :j { :k 42 } }
  ; OR
  { :kw 21 :j [{ :k 42 } {:k 43}] }
  ```

  Dealing with recursive queries is a natural fit for a recusive algorithm, and it
  is perfectly fine to invoke the `parser` function to descend the query. In fact,
  the `parser` is passed as part of your environment.

  So, the read function you write will receive three arguments, as described below:

  1. An environment containing:
      + `:ast`: An abstract syntax *tree* for the element, which contains:
         + `:type`: The type of node (e.g. :prop, :join, etc.)
         + `:dispatch-key`: The keyword portion of the triggering query element (e.g. :people/by-id)
         + `:key`: The full key of the triggering query element (e.g. [:people/by-id 1])
         + `:query`: (same as the query in `env`)
         + `:children`: If this node has sub-queries, will be AST nodes for those
         + others...see documentation
      + `:parser`: The query parser
      + `:query`: **if** the element had one E.g. `{:people [:user/name]}` has `:query` `[:user/name]`
      + Components you requested be injected
  2. A dispatch key for the item that triggered the read (same as dispatch key in the AST)
  3. Parameters (which are nil if not supplied in the query)

  It must return a value that has the shape implied the grammar element being read.

  So, lets try it out.
  ")

(defn read-42 [env key params] {:value 42})
(def parser-42 (om/parser {:read read-42}))

(defcard-doc
  "
  ### Reading a keyword

  If the parser encounters a keyword `:kw`, your function will be called with:

  ```clj
  (your-read
    { :dispatch-key :kw :parser (fn ...) } ;; the environment: parser, etc.
    :kw                                   ;; the keyword
    nil) ;; no parameters
  ```

  your read function should return some value that makes sense for
  that spot in the grammar. There are no real restrictions on what that data
  value has to be in this case. You are reading a simple property.
  There is no further shape implied by the grammar.
  It could be a string, number, Entity Object, JS Date, nil, etc.

  Due to additional features of the parser, *your return value must be wrapped in a
  map with the key `:value`*. If you fail to do this, you will get nothing
  in the result.

  Thus, a very simple read for props (keywords) could be:

  ```clj
  (defn read [env key params] { :value 42 })
  ```

  parser like this:"

(defcard-doc
  "
  The result of those nested queries is supposed to be a nested map. So, obviously we
  have more work to do.

  ### Reading a join

  Your state probably has some more structure to it than just a flat
  bag of properties. Joins are naturally recursive in syntax, and
  those that are accustomed to writing parsers probably already see the solution.

  First, let's clarify what the read function will receive for a join. When
  parsing:

  ```clj
  { :j [:a :b :c] }
  ```

  your read function will be called with:

  ```clj
  (your-read { :state state :parser (fn ...) :query [:a :b :c] } ; the environment
             :j                                                 ; keyword of the join
             nil) ; no parameters
  ```

  But just to prove a point about the separation of database format and
  query structure we'll implement this next example
  with a basic recursive parse, *but use more flat data* (the following is live code):

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source flat-app-state)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source flat-state-read)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source my-parser)
  "
  The important bit is the `then` part of the `if`. Return a value that is
  the recursive parse of the sub-query. Otherwise, we just look up the keyword
  in the state (which as you can see is a very flat map).

  The result of running this parser on the query shown is:

  "
  (my-parser {:state flat-app-state} '[:a {:user [:user/name]} :c])
  "

  The first (possibly surprising thing) is that your result includes a nested
  object. The parser creates the result, and the recursion naturally nested the
  result correctly.

  Next you should remember that join implies a there could be one OR many results.
  The singleton case is fine (e.g. putting a single map there). If there are
  multiple results it should be a vector.

  In this case, we're just showing that you can use the parser recursively
  and it in turn will call your read function again.
  In a real application, your data will not be this flat, so you
  will almost certainly not do things in quite this
  way.

  So, let's put a little better state in our application, and write a
  more realistic parser.

  ### A Non-trivial, recursive example

  Let's start with the following hand-normalized application state:

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser1/app-state)
  "
  Our friend `db->tree` could handle queries against this database,
  but let's implement it by hand.

  Say we want to run this query:

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser1/query)
  "

  From the earlier discussion you see that we'll have to handle the
  top level keys one at a time.

  For this query there are only two keys to handle: `:friends`
  and `:window-size`. So, let's write a case for each:

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser1/read)
  "

  The default case is `nil`, which means if we supply an errant key in the query no
  exception will happen.

  when we run the query, we get:

  "
  (parser1/parser {:state parser1/app-state} parser1/query)
  "

  Those of you paying close attention will notice that we have yet to need
  recursion. We've also done something a bit naive: select-keys assumes
  that query contains only keys! What if app state and query were instead:

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser2/app-state)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser2/query)
  "

  Now things get interesting, and I'm sure more than one reader will have an
  opinion on how to proceed. My aim is to show that the parser can be called
  recursively to handle these things, not to find the perfect structure for the
  parser in general, so I'm going to do something simple.

  The primary trick I'm going to exploit is the fact that `env` is just a map, and
  that we can add stuff to it. When we are in the context of a person, we'll add
  `:person` to the environment, and pass that to a recursive call to `parser`.

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser2/read)
  "
  and running the query gives the expected result:

  "
  (parser2/parser {:state parser2/app-state} parser2/query)
  "

  All of the code shown here is being actively pulled (and run) from `fulcro-devguide.state-reads.parser-2`.

  ## Parameters

  In the query grammar most kinds of rules accept parameters. These are intended
  to be combined with dynamic queries that will allow your UI to have some control
  over what you want to read from the application state (think filtering, pagination,
  sorting, and such).

  As you might expect, the parameters on a particular expression in the query
  are just passed into your read function as the third argument.
  You are responsible for both defining and interpreting them.
  They have no rules other than they are maps.

  To read the property `:load/start-time` with a parameter indicating a particular
  time unit you might use:

  ```clj
  [(:load/start-time {:units :seconds})]
  ```

  this will invoke read with:

  ```clj
  (your-read env :load/start-time { :units :seconds})
  ```

  the implication is clear. The code is up to you. Let's add some quick support for this
  in our read (in fulcro-devguide.state-reads.parser-3):
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser3/app-state)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser3/read)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source parser3/parser)
  "Now we can try the following queries:
