  # Mutation Return Values

  Note: This is a full-stack example. Make sure you're running the server and are serving this page from it. The
  displayed volume in the UI is coming from the server's mutation return value.

  There is a bit of simulated delay on the server (200ms). Notice if you click too rapidly then the value doesn't increase
  any faster than the server can respond (since it computes the new volume based on what the client sends). Opening
  the console in your devtools on the browser where you can see the transaction makes this easier to follow and understand.

  "# Explanation

  Occasionally a full-stack application will want to return a value from the server-side of a mutation. In general this
  is rarer that in other frameworks because most operations in Om Next are done optimistically (the UI drives the changes).

  The pipeline of stock Om basicaly throws away return values from server-side mutations, but does provide a way to
  make use of them. Fulcro hooks into this functionality and provides a simple way to interface with the return
  values.

  Note that Om specifically avoids asychrony whenever possible. Networking is, by nature, async in the browser. You
  application could be off doing anything at all by the time the server responds to a network request. Therefore, return
  values from mutations will have an async nature to them (they fire when they fire).

  Fulcro's method of allowing you to recieve a return value is for you to provide a function that can merge the return
  value into your app database when it arrives. Most commonly you'll do this by defining a multimethod that looks
  very similar to a Om mutation multimethod, and dispatches the same way:

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source client/merge-return-value)
  "

  You can then define methods for each mutation symbol. For example, the demo has a `rv/crank-it-up` mutation, which
  does no optimistic update. It simply sends it off to the server for processing.

  ```
  (defmethod m/mutate 'rv/crank-it-up [env k params] {:remote true})
  ```

  Our mutation asks a remote server to increase the volume. It does the computation and returns the new value
  (in this case based on the old value from the UI). It need only return a value to have it propagate to the client:

  ```
  (defmethod api/server-mutate 'rv/crank-it-up [e k {:keys [value]}]
    {:action (fn [] {:value (inc value)})})
  ```

  Handling the return value involves defining a method for that dispatch:

  ```
  (defmethod merge-return-value 'rv/crank-it-up [state _ {:keys [value]}]
    (assoc-in state [:child/by-id 0 :volume] value))
  ```

  The remainder of the setup is just giving the merge handler function to the application at startup:

  ```
  (fc/new-fulcro-client :mutation-merge merge-return-value)
  ```

  The UI code for the demo is:
